## Roadmap
[Roadmap, plan, milestone](https://github.com/abnerwei/hexo-url-submission/projects/1)

## Donate

Hexo-URL-Submssion is used to submit site URLs to major search engines, including Google, Bing, ShenMa and Baidu, to improve the speed and quality of sites included in search engines.

These three major search engines have occupied 98% of the global search engine market share (except Yandex Ru). Later, I will support api submission for more search engines.

As of August 2021, Google: 92.05%, Bing: 2.45%, Yahoo!: 1.5%, Baidu: 1.39%, Yandex: 1.21%, DuckDuckGo: 0.63%.

In China, [Baidu](https://baidu.com), [360](https://so.com), [Shenma](https://m.sm.cn/) (only app), [Toutiao](https://www.toutiao.com/), [Sogou](https://www.sogou.com/) and other search engines occupy a dominant position
